# This is my personal site

## About

This site is an outlet for me to express opinions, thoughts and stories. I don't really share this anywhere but it's fun for me to write stuff and use this a technical playground.

## Tech

-   Next.js
-   Typescript
-   Tailwind CSS

## Planning

I want to buid a db and api to store and serve data for this site - I'm slowly building a rest api in Rust and a database using MySQL.
