# Cleaning up a branch

This will cover cleaning up the commit history for a remote branch using interactive rebase

## Scenario 

We are working on a feature/bug - we have quite a few 'wip' commits on the branch and/or some other useless commit message. 

We would really to like to have some descriptive messages for the reviewer. 

## Proposed solution

`git rebase -i "HEAD~N"`

This will have to be done in the command line I believe, you may need some familiarity with vim unless your default is set to something else.

## Example

We have:
```text
blog - wip
blog - wip
new section added
```

We want:
```text
new content for rebase blog added
solution section added
```

We want to combine the two `wip` commits as these are redundant and say nothing. We also would like to give some context about the section added.

### Fixing it

```text
git rebase -i "HEAD~3"
```
