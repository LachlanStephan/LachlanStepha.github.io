# About me

I am primarily a backend dev who loves sports, video games and programming.


Some things worth noting:
- I live with my partner and my dog, it's very wholesome.
- I'm trying to read more and in turn I'm starting to enjoy writing - part of the reason for this site.
- I love tennis. Have played for ~12 years and was a professional coach for ~8 of those before switching to a career in software (June 2021).
