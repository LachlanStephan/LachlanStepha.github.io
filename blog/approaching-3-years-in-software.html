		<main>
			<p>
				It feels a little longer than that, and I'm not sure why. I'm
				glad it's still less than 3yrs, I feel like I haven't grown
				enough, but I assume that's something most people feel and I'm
				also quite certain that feeling is a trap.
			</p>
			<p>
				I often find it hard to complain about work, or life in general,
				I have a privileged job; live in a first world country; have
				never experience financial hardship - this list probably goes on
				for quite a while. On the contrary, I've been finding it hard to
				be overjoyed about things recently (I know this is sounding
				quite depressive so far, I promise I'm ok), but it's hard to get
				excited when you know it doesn't really matter
