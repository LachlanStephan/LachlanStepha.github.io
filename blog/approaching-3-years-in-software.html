			<p>
				It feels a little longer than 3 years, I'm not sure why. I'm
				glad it hasn't been very long, I feel like I haven't grown
				enough, but I assume that's something most people feel and I'm
				also quite certain that feeling is a trap.
			</p>
			<p>
				I often find it hard to complain about work, or life in general;
				I have a privileged job, live in a first world country, have
				never experience financial hardship - this list probably goes on
				for quite a while. On the contrary, I've been finding it hard to
				be overjoyed about things recently (I know this is sounding
				quite depressive so far, I promise I'm ok), but it's hard to get
				excited when you know it doesn't really matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				You know, what's the point of getting excited about some cool
				new AI feature that work is implementing when you know AI is now
				a massive contributor to climate change (something that actually
				matters). It's hard also, because at times it feels like you are
				going crazy, you think; does anyone else feel this way? Software
				is especially strange in this regard - people often adopt it as
				their entire personality...
			</p>

			<p>
				It becomes a mark against your name if you're not doing 47 side
				projects after work and maintaining a personal development list.
				This is obviously not the case for everyone (probably not the
				case for most people), and of course there are people who are
				extremely passionate, regardless of external pressures. There is
				also always the option of not participating in this - this is
				all well and good, but sometimes, just sometimes, you feel a
				little surrounded by an almost hustle culture like attitude.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'll try to surmise my problem over the next couple of
				paragraphs. Because it's not that there are people working hard
				to become better developers, self improvement and learning is
				absolutely a good thing - the problem lies with what we are
				<i>actually</i> doing, the end result.
