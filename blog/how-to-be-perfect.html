				I'm going to cover some thoughts I have about the topic and then
				provide a small review of the book
			</p>

			<p>
				The last few years and as I get older the thoughts about my
				choices and actions have really started to weigh on me and
				affect the way I stumble through life (this is often something
				that makes a person sadder). So naturally I've started reading
				about/googling moral philosophy.
			</p>

			<p>
				I think this has never been a more interesting topic then today.
				It's never been easier to make choices that result in being
				_bad_.
			</p>

			<p>
				Person A wants to buy new shoes. They go the shops, the only
				requirements they have here are comfort and style, these are
				reasonable things to have as requirements for shoe shopping. But
				in the modern world can be make for a poor choice.
			</p>

			<p>
				What if the shoes were made in a sweatshop and the CEO of the
				company is a climate change denier? We unintentionally supported
				some pretty bad shit.
			</p>

			<p>
				It's obviously impossible to be morally or ethically correct all
				the time, but that is absolutely not a reason to give up on
				trying. There are very clever people who have spent their lives
				considering these topics. I love the idea of Kantian Deontology
				but in the modern world I think this can regularly be near
				impossible to follow. Coming up with maxims for situations in
				our highly complicated society could pretty much be a full-time
				job in itself.
			</p>

			<p>
				I think ideas like Virtue ethics and Contractualism can help a
				lot in the current day - they don't seem to be held back by
				complexity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Just applying the thought process of 'do I consider that
				behaviour to be closer or further away from my golden mean' or
				'what do I owe to others' when making or reflecting on decisions
				to already be a huge help in the craziness that is the 21st
				century.
			</p>

			<p>
				This book made a complicated topic extremely approachable and
				interesting with a good amount of comedy sprinkled in (I guess
				the author <i>is</i> a comedy writer after all).
			</p>

			<p>
				He was able to simply apply moral philosophy to the complexities
				we all face and left the reader with some really good tools at
				their disposal for navigating the world in a more moral, ethical
				manner.
			</p>

			<p>
				Definitely recommend the
				<a href="https://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/how-to-be-perfect-6"
					>book</a
				>
				and the related tv show - 'The Good Place'.
