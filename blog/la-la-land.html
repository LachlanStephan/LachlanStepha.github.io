				It's 2024, a slightly strange film came out ~8years ago - La La
				Land.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think it's a good thing that I'm 8 years late on this one, I'm
				pretty convinced 18yr old me was an idiot - and I may not have
				appreciated the spectacle that is La La Land.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first ~20mins, I wasn't sure how I was going to resonate
				with the film, I'm very jaded in recent times - simply, I
				couldn't see myself feeling empathetic toward or loving the
				characters. Trying to be successful in these areas, we have too
				many people attempting, I don't think it's something we should
				be encouraging. Although, with the 2 leads being who they are,
				it was probably only a matter of time.
			</p>
			<p>
				About 5mins later, I'm more invested in these 2 people than I am
				myself, I'm completely sucked in.
			</p>
			<p>
				The dance sequences were gorgeous and fun - there's the iconic
				one atop the hill (you know the one I mean), I could watch
				re-watch this over and over... It makes me want to take dance
				lessons.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think we all like to get lost in a few things; hope, love,
				dreams... Wholly shit, this was that and so much more.
			</p>
			<p>
				This film made me feel like a hopeful kid again, and for that,
				I'm grateful - It was utterly enchanting and I believe this will
				sit me with for quite some time - it was more emotional than I
				could've anticipated.

			<p>I can't stop thinking about her day dream, her what if...</p>
