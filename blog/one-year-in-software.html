		<main>
			<p>
				I've just recently hit the one year mark of being a professional
				software developer.
			</p>
			<p>
				A year in any industry is not a lot, but in software it feels
				kinda funny. You start off knowing nothing and being very aware
				of it. Then you hit 5-6 months and think - "this whole software
				thing is easy".
			</p>
			<p>
				And that is such a hilarious thought to have because it is
				anything but easy.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the things you have to battle when being a new dev is
				your attitude. This seems like an easy thing but I've worked for
				many years before this and consider myself to be quite good in
				this regard.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's so easy in software to judge yourself by your intentions
				and others by their actions. You start to see the ~ 10 year old
				codebase and you can't help but to critisie it.
			</p>
			<p>
				You find yourself questioning everything without giving respect
				to the people and the position they were in when the decision
				was made. I've come to realise this happens to a lot of people
				for a few reasons.
			</p>
			<p>
				The obvious one is that you're only experience is with very
				small/trivial projects where it was pretty easy to keep the code
				clean and you understand most of it because... You wrote it.
				Typically you are also learning a lot about best practices and
				you have thoughts like "wow this code is terrible, this would
				never be allowed out in the industry". Then you enter the
				industry and see code that is just honestly horrific.
			</p>
			<p>
				You only begin to be become sympathetic to this after finding
				yourself in the same positions writing equally bad code.
				Deadlines approaching, pressure to deliver building and this is
				when you have a wonderful and horrible lightbulb moment that you
				have been a bit of an ass. Sometimes you just need to get the
				thing working and ship it.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is one other reason that I don't see mentioned very often
				but I think is very real. Being a little defensive. This is
				natural with software because it's so complex and mixed with
				above reason of finding complex, hard to read code you are
				immediately confronted with the thought - "I have no idea what
				I'm doing".
			</p>
			<p>
				I feel like this can easily cause one to be a little defensive
				and instead of blaming yourself and trying to figure out
				whatever convoluted code you are reading, you just blame the
				code being 'bad'.
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing I'm really trying to get better at is the balance
				between delivering code in a good amount of time and delivering
				something that is a respectable solution.
			</p>
			<p>
				I try to lean on the side of delivering a good solution as I
				genuinely believe in saving future me/us. But as we know nothing
				is black and white, and I'm sure we can all relate to having
				higher ups that aren't technical and don't care about 'code
				quality'. Or even worse, technical higher ups that don't care.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently I do not have any method for getting this balance
				right. I just try to give longer estimates and be open about
				spending time doing small refactors. I'm not having much success
				with this yet as I find code I've written even just a few weeks
				later and hate it... Hopefully I'll see this time-span get
				longer and longer.
			</p>
			<p>
				In closing, after a year I want to be a more empathetic software
				developer. But mostly I just want to be a good software
				developer... Think I'll need some patience.
