				<h1>Hi there, my name is Lach and I sometimes blog here</h1>
			</header>

			<h2>A little info:</h2>
			<p>
				I live with my partner and my dog, it's very wholesome. I write
				here rather sporadically, but when I do, it probably has
				something to do with one or more of these;
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Software</li>
				<li>Book/film reviews</li>
				<li>Morals/ethics</li>
				<li>Tennis</li>
				<li>Politics</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This blog is a personal outlet, I don't post these anywhere,
				that doesn't mean you aren't welcome to read or give feedback,
				if you feel the need - my email is in the footer.
