# Some thoughts

At the time of reading this book I have ~1.5 years as a software developer, so there are definitely things in here that I did not fully _get_. However, I think there was still a lot of value to be had.

Opinions on coding and writing good/clean are usually rather _strong_ (this book being no exception). This can be painful if people are willing to die on the hill, but otherwise I think it is healthy and important to form strong opinions.

Clean code presents quite a lot of tactics and ideas around how code should be written and presented. The author takes this to the extremes - which is good, because when you buy a book called 'Clean code', that's what you expect.

## Good

I thought this book gave me several really invaluable tools/methods for writing generally better/cleaner code that I was able to implement into my day to day almost straight away.

There is now a set of rules/ideas that I have in my head whenever I interact with code now, I think the author also does a good job of getting across the idea of taking care with your work and how easy it is for software to degrade - and that readable/clean code has to be our number one priority.

## Bad

My only criticism and I think this is more on me than on the author but some of the code examples were pretty large. This is objectively a good thing but for someone who likes to read before bed and at that point has worked all day and is tired, it was hard to digest/understand the 14 page Class example and then read the refactored version. I wouldn't mind the concept explained with smaller examples first to get the point fully across.

## Conclusion

I think in hindsight the large examples are a good thing because now I can go back and reference them and learn more from them as I keep progressing.

Still recommend the book and am very glad to have read it.
