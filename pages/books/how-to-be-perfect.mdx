# I'm going to cover some thoughts I have about the topic and then provide a small review of the book

## My interest

The last few years and as I get older the thoughts about my choices and actions have really started to weigh on me and affect the way I stumble through life (this is often something that makes a person sadder). So naturally I've started reading about/googling moral philosophy.

I think this has never been a more interesting topic then today. It's never been easier to make choices that result in being _bad_.

## An easily done but potentially poor choice

Person A wants to buy new shoes. They go the shops, the only requirements they have here are comfort and style, these are reasonable things to have as requirements for shoe shopping. But in the modern world can be make for a poor choice.

What if the shoes were made in a sweatshop and the CEO of the company is a climate change denier? We unintentionally supported some pretty bad shit.

## Trying to be/do better

It's obviously impossible to be morally or ethically correct all the time, but that is absolutely not a reason to give up on trying. There are very clever people who have spent their lives considering these topics. I love the idea of Kantian Deontology but in the modern world I think this can regularly be near impossible to follow. Coming up with maxims for situations in our highly complicated society could pretty much be a full-time job in itself.

I think ideas like Virtue ethics and Contractualism can help a lot in the current day - they don't seem to be held back by complexity.

Just applying the thought process of 'do I consider that behaviour to be closer or further away from my golden mean' or 'what do I owe to others' when making or reflecting on decisions to already be a huge help in the craziness that is the 21st century.

## Review

This book made a complicated topic extremely approachable and interesting with a good amount of comedy sprinkled in (I guess the author _is_ a comedy writer after all).

He was able to simply apply moral philosophy to the complexities we all face and left the reader with some really good tools at their disposal for navigating the world in a more moral, ethical manner.

Definitely recommend the book and the related tv show - 'The Good Place'.
