# Let's start with work

This is a delicate subject for a lot of people and there has been a huge change in the way we think about and conduct our work lately. Things like the 'Great Resignation' and employees having more power than ever. Everybody has a difference of opinion on how much we should work and how hard.

<br />

To preface everything below, I'm of the opinion we definitely work too much.

<br />
## People thinking they want/need to work hard

There is a relatively common mindset of grinding/working hard. This is an interesting one as most of the time it's rather unhealthy and can even result in the opposite of what you are trying to achieve.

<br />

I have the belief that grind culture is a trap of sorts and one that people with money/power love for us to fall into. Wouldn't it be great to have us competing with one another for promotions and tiny pay increases all the while making the company great profit.

<br />

To me this mindset is usually discrediting others hardships and misfortunes - and essentially just pulling the ladder up behind yourself.

<br />

Don't we know by now there isn't enough room at the top of the mountain...

<br />

## Folks wanting their lives back

So grind culture seems to be less common lately - I think this has to do with a few things.

<br />
-> The state of the world
<br />
-> Millennials and Gen Z
<br />
-> The pandemic
<br />
